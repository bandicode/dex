\chapter{Output}

\dex{} provides output to JSON, LaTeX and Markdown.
While the JSON output is not customizable, the others use a template engine 
that allows great flexibility.

\section{liquid template engine}

When \dex{} outputs for the first time, it will write its built-in templates 
to its AppData directory (e.g. C:/Users/username/AppData/Roaming/dex/profiles on Windows). 

Each template provides a \c{config.ini} file that describes how the output is supposed to 
be generated.

Here is an example:

\begin{code}[ini]
[general]
engine=liquid

[templates]
class=class.md
namespace=namespace.md
document=document.md
others=enum_in_class

[output]
class=classes
namespace=namespaces
document=documents
\end{code}

Under the section [templates] we can specify a template for the classes, namespaces and documents.
These templates will be used respectively for each class, namespace and document that 
have been created from the inputs.

Under this section, a comma-separated list of other templates can be specified.
These can be used with the \c{include} tag of the liquid engine.

The [output] section describes where the generated files must be written.
In the above example, for each class in the program, the \c{class.md} template will be 
used to generate a file that will be saved in directory called \c{classes}.
